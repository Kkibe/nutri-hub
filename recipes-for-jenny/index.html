    <h3>Asian Glazed Chicken Thighs</h3>
 <img src="http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/720x405/815964.jpg" alt="Asian Glazed Chicken Thigh" width="360">
    <p>Slightly spicy, but the sweetness tames the heat. Serve with rice.</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
 <ul class="ingredients-list">
  <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
  <li>1/3 cup soy sauce </li>
  <li>1/4 cup Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons Asian chili garlic sauce</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
  <li>salt to taste</li>
  <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
  <li>1 tbsp chopped green onion (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cooking Directions</h5>
 <ol>
  <li>Whisk the vinegar, honey, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, garlic, and salt in a bowl until smooth. Pour half the marinade into a large plastic zipper bag; retain the other half of the sauce. Place the chicken thighs into the bag containing marinade, squeeze all the air out of the bag, and seal. Shake a few times to coat chicken; refrigerate for 1 hour, turning bag once or twice.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Pour the other half of the marinade into a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often, to thicken sauce. Remove the chicken from the bag; discard used marinade. Place chicken thighs into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and brush with 1/3 of the thickened marinade from the saucepan.</li>
  <li>Bake 30 minutes, basting one more time after 10 minutes; an instant-read thermometer inserted into a chicken thigh should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Let stand for 5 or 10 minutes; meanwhile, bring remaining marinade back to a boil for 1 or 2 minutes, and serve chicken with marinade. Sprinkle with green onions.</li>

    <h3>General Tsao's Chicken II</h3>
 <img src="http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/632575.jpg" alt="General Tsao Chicken">
    <p>A genuinely mouthwatering dish with an Asian kick that will knock your chopsticks off! Don't be fooled by other General Tsao impostors: this is simply the best Chinese chicken you will ever have.</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
 <ul class="ingredients-list">
  <li>4 cups vegetable oil for frying </li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of white sugar</li>
  <li>1 pinch of white pepper</li>
  <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons of chopped green onion</li>
  <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
  <li>6 dried whole red chilies</li>
  <li>1 strip orange zest</li>
  <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
  <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
  <li>1/4 cup water</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cooking Directions</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Heat 4 cups vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Beat the egg in a mixing bowl. Add the chicken cubes; sprinkle with salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, and white pepper; mix well. Mix in 1 cup of cornstarch a little bit at a time until the chicken cubes are well coated.</li>
  <li>In batches, carefully drop the chicken cubes into the hot oil one by one, cooking until they turns golden brown and begin to float, about 3 minutes. Remove the chicken and allow to cool as you fry the next batch. Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. Cook until the chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
  <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir a minute or two until the garlic has turned golden and the chiles brighten. Add 1/2 cup sugar, the ginger, chicken broth, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and peanut oil; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Dissolve 2 teaspoons of cornstarch into the water, and stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute. Stir the chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook for a few minutes until the chicken absorbs some of the sauce.</li>
